# Basic Python Package Structure

This is my basic Python package structure. It is based on the [Hitchhiker's Guide to Python's Structuring Your Project page](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/), with some of my own additional preferences involved.

## Steps To Use

1. Fork this repository into your own repo on GitHub
1. In setup.py, change the ```NAME```, ```DESCRIPTION```, and ```URL``` variables according to your project's name, descriptionm and url
1. Change the LICENSE file to the license you would like to use
1. Change the name of the {{project_name}} folder to your project's name
1. In tests/context.py, change the final import statement to reflect your project's name
1. And finally, adjust your README.md file accordingly
